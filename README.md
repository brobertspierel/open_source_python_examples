### Open Source Python Examples 

## Rasters

# GDAL 

	- Command line vs Python implementation 
	- Virtual rasters 
	- Clipping? 

# Numpy 
	- Array based operations vs for loops 
	- Masking
	- Multi-dimensional arrays? 

# Rasterio 
	- Window-based operations 
	- GIS-like functionality (clipping)

## Vectors 

# Pandas 
	- General tabular data 
	- Possible to use in conjunction with geospatial data (e.g. joins, merges etc.)

# Geopandas 
	- Very easy manipulation of geospatial datasets 
	- Comes with many tools that are akin to GIS GUIs

# OGR
	- Alternative to Geopandas, can be faster
	- Functionality a bit more verbose 

## Plotting and figure building 

# Matplotlib 
	- Standard plotting library, a lot of functionality and basis for many other things 

# Seaborn 
	- Good for more complex data or multi-dimensional plots 

## Google Earth Engine API 

	- Good for generating a large number of tasks 
	- Integration with AI/ML/DL e.g., pytorch, tensorflow
